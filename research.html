                <h3>Taxation-Induced Tenancy: Evidence from Washington DC</h3>
                <p class="authors">T. M. Jensen Ahokovi</p>
                <div class="abstract">
                    <p>Vacancy taxation is gaining popularity as a policy tool to address affordable housing shortages and promote urban revitalization. Despite this growing interest, there is a notable gap in the literature assessing the effectiveness of the policy. This paper is the first to examine the effects of vacancy taxation in the context of the United States, and capitalizes on a significant policy change -- a major property tax reform in Washington D.C. -- as a natural experiment. Employing a combination of standard and novel synthetic event study designs, I find evidence that the policy precipitated a large reduction in residential vacancies and an increase in occupied housing units.</p>

                <h3>The Supply Effects of Rent Control: New Evidence from New York</h3>
                <p class="authors">T. M. Jensen Ahokovi</p>
                <div class="abstract">
                    <p>This paper employs a synthetic difference-in-differences design to investigate the impact of a major policy change in New York's rent control law, as measured by the number of new private residential housing units authorized by permits. Contrary to arguments in favor of rent control as a mechanism to mitigate rising housing costs, I find a significant decrease in the number of housing units authorized following the policy change under study. This reduction is most pronounced in the multifamily housing sector.</p>
